            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small">Python is one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world, due to its high usability and large collection of libraries. This learning path provides an application-driven introduction to using advanced Python features
                for offensive and defense cybersecurity. This path demonstrates how some of the advanced functionality in Python packages can be applied to cybersecurity and how to automate multi-stage attack chains and defensive operations using Python.
                This Advanced Python Scripting for Cybersecurity Skills Path builds on the Python for Cybersecurity skills path to demonstrate advanced applications of Python for cybersecurity. When you finish every course and complete the hands-on project,
                you'll earn a Certificate that you can share with prospective employers and your professional network.This course demonstrates the use of Python to establish command-and-control channels between a target environment and the attackers infrastructure.
                This course also demonstrates the use of Python to collect information on a system, including both user credentials and other sensitive data.</p>

Advance your Software Engineering or Data Science Career by Learning Algorithms through Programming and Puzzle Solving. Ace coding interviews by implementing each algorithmic challenge in this Specialization.
                Apply the newly-learned algorithmic techniques to real-life problems, such as analyzing a huge social network or sequencing a genome of a deadly pathogen.Play with 50 algorithmic puzzles on your smartphone to develop your algorithmic intuition!
                Apply algorithmic techniques (greedy algorithms, binary search, dynamic programming, etc.) and data structures (stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) to solve 100 programming challenges that often appear at interviews at high-tech companies.
                Get an instant feedback on whether your solution is correct.Apply the newly learned algorithms to solve real-world challenges: navigating in a Big Network or assembling a genome of a deadly pathogen from millions of short substrings of
                its DNA.This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is
                a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice.

            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small">A growing number of exciting, well-paying jobs in today’s security industry do not require a college degree. This 8-course Professional Certificate will give you the technical skills to become job-ready for a Cybersecurity Analyst role. Instructional
                content and labs will introduce you to concepts including network security, endpoint protection, incident response, threat intelligence, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment. Cybersecurity is one of the most in-demand career
                fields. According to CyberSeek, from June 2019  through May 2020, there were 171,000 openings for Information Security Analysts, but only 125,000 workers currently employed in those positions – an annual talent shortfall of 46,000 workers.
                On average, cybersecurity roles take 21% longer to fill than other IT jobs. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects 31% hiring growth for Cybersecurity Analysts between 2019 and 2029, growing much faster than average in other careers.
                This program is suitable for learners entering the workforce and professionals switching careers. You should be comfortable working with computers, be willing to develop new technical skills, and enjoy collaborative problem solving and
                communicating solutions.</p>

            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small "> Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the
                web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones. In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs
                to know. We will start from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based
                on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, we will get a thorough introduction
                to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to
                the end user.</p>
